# Project Rules

## 1. Development Process
- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Always write a verifiable test case or define a strict acceptance metric BEFORE writing implementation code.
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Ensure tests fail before fixing them.

## 2. Ecosystem & Dependencies
- **No Reinventing Wheels**: Prioritize established npm packages or Swift libraries over custom implementations.
- **Dependency Management**: Strictly manage versions in `package.json`.

## 3. Documentation (Doc-First)
- **Centralized Docs**: All design decisions, architectural changes, and rules must be recorded in the `docs/` directory.
- **Traceability**: Code changes should track back to a documented requirement or bug report.

## 4. Code Quality
- **Review**: Self-review code against these rules before submitting.
