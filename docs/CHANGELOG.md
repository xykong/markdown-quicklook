# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Build System**: Optimized build logs for `make install`, `make app`, and `make generate`. Now uses minimal output mode (warnings & errors only) to reduce terminal noise.
- **Appearance**: Changed default appearance mode to **Light** (previously followed system settings).
- **Installation**: Updated `install.sh` to build `Release` configuration by default and robustly locate the built application in DerivedData.
- **Host App**: Improved `index.html` resource discovery logic to fallback to multiple directories.

### Fixed
- **Renderer**: Switched from Webpack/Vite chunked build to **Vite SingleFile** build. This fixes the "White Screen" issue in QuickLook by inlining all JS/CSS/Font assets into a single `index.html`, avoiding CORS/file-access restrictions in the Sandbox.
- **Build**: Increased Webpack asset size limits to suppress warnings for large bundles (Mermaid/KaTeX/Highlight.js).
- **Stability**: Added auto-reload recovery when WebView WebContent process terminates.
- **Security**: Added missing entitlements (Network Client, JIT, Printing, Downloads) to support WebView features and stability.

### Added
- **Appearance Settings**: Added "View" > "Appearance" menu to switch between Light, Dark, and System modes.
- **Host App Browser**: The main app now functions as a standalone Markdown viewer/editor (Read-Only mode).
  - Supports opening local `.md` files via Finder or File > Open.
  - Implemented `MarkdownWebView` with `baseUrl` injection for resolving local resources.
  - Added support for rendering local images (e.g., `![alt](image.png)`).
  - Implemented navigation handling: External links open in Safari, local `.md` links open in new App windows.
- **Architecture**:
  - Adopted SwiftUI `DocumentGroup` for file management.
  - Updated `web-renderer` to accept `baseUrl` option in `renderMarkdown`.
  - Updated `project.yml` to bundle renderer assets into the Host App.
- **Documentation**:
  - Added `docs/DESIGN_HOST_APP_BROWSER.md`.
  - Added `docs/OPTIMIZATION_ROADMAP.md`: Detailed analysis of performance and UX improvement opportunities.
