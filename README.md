# Markdown Preview Enhanced for macOS QuickLook

[中文 README](README_ZH.md)

A macOS QuickLook extension to beautifully preview Markdown files with full rendering, syntax highlighting, math formulas, and diagram support.

**Inspired by and partially based on [markdown-preview-enhanced](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced).**

## Features

- **Markdown**: CommonMark + GFM (Tables, Task Lists, Strikethrough)
- **Math**: KaTeX support for mathematical expressions (`$E=mc^2$`)
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid support for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, etc.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks with language-specific highlighting
- **Emoji**: Full emoji support with `:emoji_name:` syntax
- **Theme**: Automatic light/dark mode based on system settings

## Acknowledgements

## Quick Start

### Installation

Run the installation script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This will:
1. Build the application with all dependencies
2. Install it to `/Applications/Markdown Preview Enhanced.app`
3. Register it with the system
4. Reset QuickLook cache

### ⚠️ Critical Activation Step

**The QuickLook extension will NOT work until you complete this step:**

1. **Right-click** (or Control+click) on any `.md` file in Finder
2. Select **"Get Info"** (or press `⌘+I`)
3. In the **"Open with:"** section, select **Markdown Preview Enhanced.app**
4. Click the **"Change All..."** button
5. Confirm by clicking **"Continue"**

This sets Markdown Preview Enhanced as the default application for all `.md` files, which is **required** for macOS to use our QuickLook extension.

### Testing

After completing the activation step above, test the extension:

```bash
qlmanage -p test-sample.md
```

Or simply select any `.md` file in Finder and press Space (QuickLook shortcut).
