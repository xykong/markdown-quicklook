# Markdown Preview Enhanced for macOS QuickLook

[中文 README](README_ZH.md)

A macOS QuickLook extension to beautifully preview Markdown files with full rendering, syntax highlighting, math formulas, and diagram support.

**Inspired by and partially based on [markdown-preview-enhanced](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced).**

## Features

- **Markdown**: CommonMark + GFM (Tables, Task Lists, Strikethrough)
- **Math**: KaTeX support for mathematical expressions (`$E=mc^2$`)
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid support for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, etc.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks with language-specific highlighting
- **Emoji**: Full emoji support with `:emoji_name:` syntax
- **Table of Contents**: Auto-generated, collapsible navigation panel with smart highlighting
- **Theme**: Configurable appearance (Light, Dark, or System). Defaults to Light mode for better readability.
- **Zoom**: Keyboard shortcuts (`Cmd +/-/0`) and scroll wheel zoom (0.5x - 3.0x) with persistence

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Method 1: Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew tap xykong/tap
brew install --cask markdown-preview-enhanced
```

#### Method 2: Manual Installation (DMG)

### 🛑 Troubleshooting: "App is damaged" or "Unidentified Developer"

Since this app is open-source and not notarized by Apple, you might see an error saying **"Markdown Preview Enhanced.app is damaged and can't be opened"** or **"cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"**.

**Option 1: Command Line (Recommended)**

Run the following command in Terminal to remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/Markdown Preview Enhanced.app"
```

**Option 2: Manual Authorization**

1. Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**.
2. Scroll down to the **Security** section.
3. You should see a message saying "Markdown Preview Enhanced.app was blocked...".
4. Click **Open Anyway**.
5. Enter your password to confirm.

Then try opening the app again.

### Testing

After completing the activation step above, test the extension:

```bash
qlmanage -p test-sample.md
```

Or simply select any `.md` file in Finder and press Space (QuickLook shortcut).
